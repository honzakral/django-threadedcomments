{% extends "core/base.html" %}{% load i18n %}
{% comment %}

  To implement django.contrib.comments in your web site,
  it is recommended to override the following templates in your app:

     comments/base.html    - map the blocks 'title' and 'contents' to your base template.
     comments/posted.html  - provide a decent redirect back to the article.

  Other templates could also be overwritten off course, but these two are the basic ones.
  Features such as editing posts, spam protection, recaptcha, twitter/facebook/openid login etc..
  are all subject to different applications which can add those features.
  They don't belong in django-threadedcomments, and hence are not demonstrated here.

{% endcomment %}

{% block head_title %}{% block title %}{% trans "Responses for page" %}{% endblock %}{% endblock %}

{# 'content' block is already defined in the base class, no need to redefine it here. #}
